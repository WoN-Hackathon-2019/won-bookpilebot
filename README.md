# Web of Needs - BookPileBot

The bot reacts to user book needs, crawls search results from https://buechereien.wien.gv.at/ related to the need and generates atoms for each of them.

The bot can be interacted with in three ways:
* generate an atom "Find a Book" with the search query as the Title
* generate an atom "Look for something" and relate it to books by adding a tag that cointains the word "book", "buch" or "b√ºcher"
  search query as Title or ISBN (if ISBN is filled in this is used for the search query no matter the title)
* connect with the bots atom and send him a message containing the book title or isbn you are looking for

The BookPileBot is a [Spring Boot Application](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-running-your-application.html).

## Cooperations
The [BookMatchBot](https://github.com/orgs/WoN-Hackathon-2019/teams/bookmatchbot)
uses our generated atoms to match with user generated atoms searching for books.

Further more, we used their BookAtomModelWrapper and extended it.

## Running the bot

### Prerequisites

- [Openjdk 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html) - the method described here does **not work** with the Oracle 8 JDK!
- Maven framework set up

### On the command line

```
cd won-bookpilebot
export WON_NODE_URI="https://hackathonnode.matchat.org/won"
mvn clean package
java -jar target/bot.jar
```
Now go to [What's new](https://hackathon.matchat.org/owner/#!/overview) to find your bot, connect and [create an atom](https://hackathon.matchat.org/owner/#!/create) or message your bot to see the bot in action.

### In Intellij Idea
1. Create a run configuration for the class `won.bot.bookpile.BookPileBot`
2. Add the environment variables

  * `WON_NODE_URI` pointing to your node uri (e.g. `https://hackathonnode.matchat.org/won` without quotes)
  
  to your run configuration.
  
3. Run your configuration

If you get a message indicating your keysize is restricted on startup (`JCE unlimited strength encryption policy is not enabled, WoN applications will not work. Please consult the setup guide.`), refer to [Enabling Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](https://github.com/open-eid/cdoc4j/wiki/Enabling-Unlimited-Strength-Jurisdiction-Policy) to increase the allowed key size.

##### Optional Parameters for both Run Configurations:
- `WON_KEYSTORE_DIR` path to folder where `bot-keys.jks` and `owner-trusted-certs.jks` are stored (needs write access and folder must exist)
